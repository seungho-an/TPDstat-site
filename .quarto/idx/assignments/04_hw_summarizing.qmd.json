In a recent paper, Adam N. Glynn and Maya Sen argue that having a female child causes circuit court judges to make more pro-feminist decisions.

In the first chunk for this question use `read_csv` to load the `data/judges.csv` file into a data frame called `judges`. In this exercise, you will create a cross-tab that shows the gender breakdown within each party. In particular, the result should be a table with 2 rows and 3 columns, where the rows represent each gender and the columns correspond to party. In the end, you should have a table that looks like this (with the correct proportion, not these made up ones):\n\n| Gender | Democrat | Republican |\n|:-------|---------:|-----------:|\n| Man    |      0.5 |        0.6 |\n| Woman  |      0.5 |        0.4 |\n\nNote that the columns here sum to 1. You can create this using the following data wrangling steps:\n\n- Overwrite the `judges` tibble with the same tibble with two newly created variables: one variable called `Gender` variable to be labelled `\"Woman\"` and `\"Man\"` based on the variable `woman` and another variable called `Party` to be labelled `\"Republican\"` and `\"Democrat\"` based on the `republican` variable. \n- Use the `judges` tibble to create the cross-tab and save it as `gender_party_table`. It should have 2 rows and 3 columns (\"Gender\", \"Republican\", and \"Democrat\"). Be very careful about the ordering of your grouping and remember that `summarize()` drops the last group by default when there is more than one group. You should use `group_by()`, `summarize()`, `mutate()`, and `pivot_wider()` to accomplish this. (**Hint:** if you are ending up with the wrong number of rows, make sure that the only variables in the tibble when you try to use `pivot_wider` are the two grouping variables and the proportion variable.) \n- Pass `gender_party_table` to `knitr::kable()` to create a nicely formatted version of this table. \n\n\nIn your write-up, answer the following questions:\n\n- How many judges are in this data set?\n- What proportion of the judges are men? (hint: use `mean`)\n- From your table, is the gender breakdown different for judges appointed by Democratic vs Republican presidents?\n\n **Rubric:** 2pts for creating `Gender` and `Party` (autograder); 5pts for `gender_party_table` (autograder); 1pt for properly formatted table (PDF); 2pts for answering question (PDF).\n\n## Question 2 (7 points)\n\nUse `group_by` and `summarize` to calculate the mean of `progressive_vote` in each combination of the `Gender` and `Party` variables you created in question 1 and save this tibble as `gender_party_means` (this tibble should have columns `Gender`, `Party`, and `progressive_vote`). Use this table to recreate the following barplot:\n\n![](figures/gender_party_plot.png)\n\nThe autograder will check the aesthetic mappings, the correct placement of the bars, and the labels, but you do not need to match the exact colors (they are `\"steeblue1\"` and `\"indianred1\"` if you do want to match, though).\n\nIn the main text, briefly interpret the results of the analysis by describing which party and which gender tend to be more progress. Comment on whether there are larger differences across party or across gender in terms of progressive voting. Should we interpret any of these effects causally? Why or why not?\n\n **Rubric:** 2pts for `gender_party_means` table (autograder); 3pts for `gender_party_plot` (autograder); 2pts for interpretation (PDF)\n\n\n## Question 3 (9 points)\n\nWhat is the difference in the proportion of pro-feminist decisions between judges who have at least one daughter and those who do not have any? To compute this difference, first create a variable called `any_girls` that is `\"Any Girls\"` when the judge has at least 1 girl and `\"No Girls\"` otherwise and save this variable back to the `judges` tibble. Then, created a new tibble called `parents` that is filtered to contain judges that have at least one child. Create an object called `vote_by_girls` that has three columns: the unique values of the `any_girls` variable, the mean of the `progressive_vote` variable for each value of `any_girls` (column called `progressive_mean`), and the standard deviation of `progressive_vote` for each value of `any_girls` (column called `progressive_sd`). Present the table using `knitr::kable()`. \n\nIn the main text, describe which group has a higher average progressive vote and which group's distribution has more spread. Why might we worry about interpreting any difference in means causally, considering number of children as a possible confounder?\n\n **Rubric:** 1pt for creating `any_girls` variable (autograder); 1pt for creating `parents` tibble (autograder); 4pts for creating the `vote_by_girls` table (autograder); 1pt for description of the table (PDF); 2pts for discussion of causality (PDF).\n\n## Question 4 (9 points)\n\nGiven that the number of children might be a confounder for the relationship between number of girls and voting, let's estimate the average treatment effects of having girls using statistical control for the number of children among judges that have one to three children (that is, first filter to judges that only have between 1 and 3 children, inclusive). Your final table should be called `ate_nkids` and should be a tibble that has two columns: one with the number of children (1, 2, and 3) and the other with the estimated ATEs of `any_girls` for each of those levels. Print out this table using the `knitr::kable()` command.\n\nAre these estimated effects largely similar or largely different than what you found using all of the data? What assumption do you need to make to interpret these effects causally? Do you think it is plausible in this case?\n\n **Rubric:** 6pts for `ate_nkids` (autograder); 1pt for nicely formatted table (PDF); 2pts for discussion (PDF)\n\n## Question 5 (EXTRA CREDIT, 5 points)\n\n**This problem is optional. Any points earned on this problem can be applied to lost points on other parts of the problem set. You cannot earn more than the maximum score on the problem set. There will be no autograder for this question.**\n\nLet's consider the design of this study. The original authors assume that, conditional on the number of children a judge has, the number of daughters is random (as we did in the previous question). If this is true, half of a judge's children should be female, on average. A deviation from this proportion could indicate that a gender preference among judges due a stopping rule such as \"have children until we get one girl,\" which would violate the randomization assumption.\n\nTo check this assumption, group the data by the number of children and calculate the proportion of children in each group that are girls. Create a barplot that these proportions on the y-axis with the number of children on the x-axis. This barplot should have (a) informative labels on each axis, (b) a y-axis range that runs from 0 to 1, and (c) a horizontal line at 0.5 to compare against.  Does it appear that there is strong gender preference/selection happening among judges?\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"04_hw_summarizing.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","_quarto-vars":{"author":"Seung-Ho An","instructor":{"name":"Prof. Seung-Ho An","name_no_title":"Seung-Ho An","office":"SS 135","email":"seunghoan@arizona.edu","url":"https://www.seunghoan.com","twitter":"seunghoan","contact_policy":"We will have a team chat on \"Teams.\" If you have any questions, feel free to send me an email.
