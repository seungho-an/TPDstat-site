You should only have one package per library call. \n\n```{r}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n\n### Calling functions from specific packages\n\nWe can also use the `mypackage::` prefix to access package functions without loading:\n\n```{r}\nknitr::kable(head(mtcars))\n```\n\n## Data Visualization (week 1)\n\n### Scatter plot\n\nYou can produce a scatter plot with using the `x` and `y` aesthetics along with the `geom_point()` function. \n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = midwest,\n       mapping = aes(x = popdensity,\n                     y = percbelowpoverty)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n\n### Smoothed curves \n\nYou can add a smoothed curve that summarizes the relationship between two variables with the `geom_smooth()` function. By default, it uses a  loess smoother to estimated the conditional mean of the y-axis variable as a function of the x-axis variable. \n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = midwest,\n       mapping = aes(x = popdensity,\n                     y = percbelowpoverty)) +\n  geom_point() + geom_smooth()\n```\n\n\n### Adding a regression line \n\n`geom_smooth` can also add a regression line by setting the argument `method = \"lm\"` and we can turn off the shaded regions around the line with `se = FALSE`\n\n```{r }\nggplot(data = midwest,\n       mapping = aes(x = popdensity,\n                     y = percbelowpoverty)) +\n  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)\n```\n\n### Changing the scale of the axes\n\nIf we want the scale of the x-axis to be logged to stretch out the data we can use the `scale_x_log10()`:\n\n```{r }\nggplot(data = midwest,\n       mapping = aes(x = popdensity,\n                     y = percbelowpoverty)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_log10()\n```\n\n### Adding informative labels to a plot\n\nUse the `labs()` to add informative labels to the plot:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: labels\nggplot(data = midwest,\n       mapping = aes(x = popdensity,\n                     y = percbelowpoverty)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_log10() +\n  labs(x = \"Population Density\",\n       y = \"Percent of County Below Poverty Line\",\n       title = \"Poverty and Population Density\",\n       subtitle = \"Among Counties in the Midwest\",\n       source = \"US Census, 2000\")\n```\n\n### Mapping aesthetics to variables\n\nIf you would like to map an aesthetic to a variable for all geoms in the plot, you can put it in the `aes` call in the `ggplot()` function:\n\n```{r }\nggplot(data = midwest,\n       mapping = aes(x = popdensity,\n                     y = percbelowpoverty,\n                     color = state,\n                     fill = state)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  scale_x_log10()\n```\n\n\n### Mapping aesthetics for a single geom\n\nYou can also map aesthetics for a specific geom using the `mapping` argument to that function:\n\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = midwest,\n       mapping = aes(x = popdensity,\n                     y = percbelowpoverty)) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = state)) +\n  geom_smooth(color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_log10()\n```\n\n### Setting the aesthetics for all observations\n\nIf you would like to set the color or size or shape of a geom for all data points (that is, not mapped to any variables), be sure to set these outside of `aes()`:\n\n```{r }\nggplot(data = midwest,\n       mapping = aes(x = popdensity,\n                     y = percbelowpoverty)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"purple\") +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  scale_x_log10()\n```\n\n### Histograms\n\n```{r}\n#| label: histogram\nggplot(data = midwest,\n       mapping = aes(x = percbelowpoverty)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"cheatsheet.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","_quarto-vars":{"author":"Seung-Ho An","instructor":{"name":"Prof. Seung-Ho An","name_no_title":"Seung-Ho An","office":"SS 135","email":"seunghoan@arizona.edu","url":"https://www.seunghoan.com","twitter":"seunghoan","contact_policy":"We will have a team chat on \"Teams.\" If you have any questions, feel free to send me an email.
