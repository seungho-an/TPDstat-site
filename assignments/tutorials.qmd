## Installing the TPDstat tutorials package

In this class, we will be installing R tutorials locally to your RStudio. To install the package that contains the tutorials for the class run the following lines of code, each entered separately. Note that you may be asked to update packages when you enter this code. You can select 1 for "All" to perform any updates. 

```{r}
#| eval = FALSE
remotes::install_github("kosukeimai/qss-package", build_vignettes = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("rstudio/learnr")
remotes::install_github("rstudio-education/gradethis")
remotes::install_github("seungho-an/TPDtutor")
```

After the package has been installed, you should be able to find all of the tutorials for the course in the "Tutorials" tab in the top-right pane of RStudio. Scroll down to find a TPDstat tutorial and click "Start Tutorial" to launch a tutorial:

![](/files/img/assignments/rstudio-tutorials.png){fig-alt="RStudio Tutorials Tab"}

If you do not see any QSS tutorials after scrolling to the bottom, try to restart RStudio, and check again. If you still don't see any tutorials, confirm that you have installed the package by running `library(TPDtutor)`. If you get an error about the package not being installed, try the above installation procedure again and note any error messages you receive before reaching out to the teaching staff for assistance. 


## FAQs

### What if I receive an error about `pdflatex` and the submission report doesn't download?

Here, you do not need to generate the report since there will be no grading in this class. Yet, if you still want to see the outcome, you need install LaTeX using the following command:

```{r}
#| eval = FALSE
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX
```

### What if I don't see a Tutorial tab in RStudio?

Make sure that you have RStudio version 1.3 or higher installed on your computer. On a Mac, you can check the version by going to the top left of the menu bar (next to the Apple logo) and clicking on "RStudio" then "About RStudio". On a Windows PC, you can find the same item under File > About.

### What if my submission report misses some of my attempts?

The submission report isn't perfect and will sometimes say you didn't attempt a question when you actually did. So, don't worry about it.
